Apex REST restriction (future implementation idea)

- Goal: Limit the extension to call only Apex REST endpoints to enforce least privilege.
- Mechanism:
  - In the background proxy, allowlist paths that start with /services/apexrest/.
  - Route all extension-initiated API calls through these Apex endpoints only.
- Server side:
  - Expose required operations via Apex @RestResource controllers “with sharing”.
  - Apply Profiles/Permission Sets for CRUD/FLS; add input validation and logging.
- Benefits:
  - Stronger server-side authorization and auditability.
  - Prevents accidental access to generic REST/Tooling endpoints.
- Trade-offs:
  - Requires deploying and maintaining Apex controllers.
  - Reduces flexibility for ad-hoc queries/operations.
- Rollout notes:
  - Make the allowlist toggleable (config flag) for dev vs prod.
  - Document allowed routes and expected payloads in README when enabled.
